Heart Disease Prediction - DSN Competition

This repository contains my submission for the Heart Disease Machine Learning Competition organized by Data Science Nigeria (DSN). The goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and demographic data.

📂 Project Structure
data/: Contains the training and testing datasets.
DSN Hackaton: Jupyter notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.

🔍 Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed key features and their relationships with heart disease.
Visualized trends and correlations.

Feature Engineering:
Performed missing value imputation.
Applied scaling and transformation techniques.
Selected optimal features using recursive feature elimination (RFE).

Modeling:
Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

🚀 Key Insights
The Random Forest model achieved the highest ROC-AUC of 0.88, making it the best-performing model.
Key features influencing predictions: age, cholesterol level, and maximum heart rate achieved.
